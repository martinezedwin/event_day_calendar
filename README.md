event_day_calendar
==================

A small challenge to create a self-contained JS file that would handle event scheduling.
The time begins at 9:00AM and ends at 9:00PM. To run:

layOutDay([{ start: 30, end: 180 }])

This will create an event that starts at 9:30AM and end at 12:00PM. The  
challenge was creating side-by-side events, which is where the algorithm 
logic comes in.
